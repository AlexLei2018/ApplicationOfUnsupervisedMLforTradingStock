### **Purpose of this Repository**

The primary goal of this repository is to provide practical illustrations of the concepts, theories, and methodologies discussed in the book. The code serves to demonstrate the fundamental logic and execution of unsupervised learning techniques applied to stock trading, from data preprocessing and structure discovery to intelligent stock selection.

### **Important Notes Regarding the Code**

*   **Illustrative, Not Production-Ready:** The code provided here is primarily for **educational and illustrative purposes**. It is designed to clarify the principles and steps outlined in the book. While functional, it may not be optimized for production environments, real-time trading, or highly complex, large-scale financial applications.
*   **Snapshot of Development:** During the book's writing and editing process, the code underwent continuous development and refinement. While efforts have been made to align the repository code with the book's explanations, there might be **minor variations or stylistic differences** from the exact code snippets printed in the book. These changes are typically for clarity, efficiency, or to reflect updated library versions.
*   **Focus on Concepts:** The **core focus of this code is to illuminate the theoretical underpinnings, basic logic, and methodology** presented in the book. Any minor discrepancies in the code **will not impede the understanding of the book's core concepts, problems, or solutions.** The intent is to show *how* the theories work in practice.
*   **Data Dependencies:** Some code examples may require specific datasets. Instructions on how to acquire or simulate relevant data will be provided within individual code files or accompanying documentation (if any).
*   **Dependencies:** Please refer to `requirements.txt` (if applicable) or the individual script headers for necessary Python packages and their versions.

### **Getting Started**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
